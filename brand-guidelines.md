## ✍️ Voice & Copy Guidelines

### Write like this:
- “Let’s get you unstuck.”
- “Here’s what’s broken — and how to fix it.”
- “Launch fast. Learn faster.”

### Avoid:
- “Welcome to your productivity transformation journey.”
- “Leverage synergies to unlock scalable ideation flows.”
- Basically anything that sounds like it came from a LinkedIn AI bot.

## 💬 Tagline

**Accelerate. Innovate. Deliver.**

Use this under the logo, in footers, and as a rhythm in copy.

---

## ✅ Use BrAInstormX When:
- Naming features/tools
- Talking about AI output
- Signing off with personality

> Example:  
> “That’s a wrap — your homepage just got BrAInstormX’d.”

---

## ❌ Don’t Do This
- Don’t refer to the user as “the business” — speak to *them.*
- Don’t apologize for being fast, snappy, or sharp. That’s the point.
- Don’t water it down to be more "professional." This **is** professional — just modern.

---

## 🧢 For Visual Creators:
- Red is used for *action and movement*, not decoration.
- Typography should feel **confident**. Big. Clean. Unapologetic.
- Imagery = abstract, focused, idea-based. No stock photos of handshakes.

---

## 🎯 TL;DR

BrAInstormX isn’t trying to be another SaaS. We’re here to:
- Call BS on fluff
- Make thinking faster
- And help people actually do the damn thing

Keep it tight. Keep it honest. Keep it moving.
